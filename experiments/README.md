# Experiments

This directory contains experimental scripts and research code.

## 📈 Experimental Scripts

### 🔬 Model Comparison Experiments
- **[run_pytorch_comparison.py](run_pytorch_comparison.py)** - Run comprehensive PyTorch comparison experiments

## Purpose

Experimental scripts are used for:
- Testing new approaches
- Research and development
- Performance benchmarking
- Exploring alternative implementations

## Running Experiments

```bash
# Run PyTorch comparison experiments
python experiments/run_pytorch_comparison.py
```

## Guidelines

When adding experimental code:
1. Place experimental scripts in this `experiments/` directory
2. Clearly document the experimental nature and goals
3. Include results and findings in comments
4. Move stable code to appropriate directories (src/, analysis/, etc.)
5. Update this README when experiments become stable features
